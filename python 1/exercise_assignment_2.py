# CHAPTER 5

# 1. Create a variable named num_1 and assign 28 to it (1 pt.).
num_1 = 28
# 2. Create a variable named num_2 and assign 63 to it (1 pt.).
num_2 = 63
# 3. Add num_1 to num_2 and store it in ans_one, print ans_one (2 pts.).
ans_one = (num_1 + num_2)
print (ans_one)
# 4. Subtract num_1 from num_2 and store it in ans_two, print ans_two (2 pts.).
ans_two = (num_2 - num_1)
print (ans_two)

# 5. Multiply num_1 by num_2 and store it in ans_three, print ans_three (2 pts.).
ans_three = (num_1 * num_2)
print(ans_three)
# 6. Divide num_2 by num_1 and store it in ans_four, print ans_four (2 pts.).
ans_four = (num_2 / num_1)
print(ans_four)

# 7. Use the integer division operator to divide num_2 by num_1 and store it in ans_five, print ans_five (2 pts.).
ans_five = num_2 // num_1
print(ans_five)

# 8. Return the remainder of num_2 divided by num_1 and store it in ans_six, print ans_six (2 pts.).
ans_six = num_2 % num_1
print(ans_six)
# 9. Use the is_integer method to check if num is an integer and print the value returned by the method (2 pts.).
num = 28.6 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE
is_integer = num.is_integer()
print(is_integer)
# 10. Use the pow function to print out 6 raised to the power of -4 (1 pt.).
pf = pow(6,-4)
print(pf)
# 11. Print num_3 so that 3 decimal places are displayed and it is grouped by thousands (1 pt.).
num_3 = 987654321.123456789 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE
th = round(num_3,3)
print(th)
# 12. Write a print statement using an f-string that prints out the following sentence using the variables defined below.
# In 2020, Australia had a population of 25,660,000 and a life expectancy of 83.2 years. The round function
# should not be used (2 pts.).
year = 2020 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE
population = 25660000 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE
expectancy = 83.2031 # DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS LINE OF CODE
sentence = f"In {year}, Australia had a population of {population} and a life expectancy of {expectancy:.1f}."
print(sentence)
